# mini-project-landing-page

## Purpose

The purpose of this assignment was to create a "landing page" where the user could see a basic website for a fictitious company (Caffeine Therapy). The website was required to have various sections such as a navigation bar, some paragraphs of text, an image, links, and a header and footer. A CSS page was also required containing universal, body and tag rulesets to style the HTML markup appropriately.

## Process

Lessons learned from prior class sessions were utilized to assemble the HTML and corresponding CSS pages, with frequent double-checking of syntax and proper markup syntax.
